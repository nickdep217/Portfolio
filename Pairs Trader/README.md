Pairs Trader:
  Pairs trader is a trading program that attempts to make profit off of arbitrage between two stocks whose price movement is correlated. To do this the program trades long on one of assets and short on the other asset. This essentially creates a price "spread" between the two assets. Since the prices of the two assets are correlated the "spread price" theoretically should not move significantly in either direction throughout the day. This is advantageos for pairs trading for a few reasons:
    -Less directional price movement
    -Market nuetral -> theoretically less market risk
    -Higher frequency of oscillations -> more arbitrage opportunities

  To code pairs trader I will be using a similar code structure to the Simple scalper. I will keep my code updated as I make big additions
