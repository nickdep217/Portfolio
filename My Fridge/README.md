This is a project I did at Google Computer Science Summer institute. The purpose of this website is to find recipes with things that are already in your refrigerator. To run this project you will need to get your own api keys from rapid api and input it in the api_key.py file. There may still be a few bugs, due to time constraints we did not do extensive testing or error handling.
